This project is a Speech-to-Text (STT) application built using modern web development technologies. The application allows users to convert spoken input into text.

## Features

- Convert speech to text
- User-friendly interface
- Real-time speech recognition

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Web Vitals**: A set of metrics to measure the user experience of a web page.
- **Web Speech API**: Used for speech recognition (assumed for STT functionality).

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/speech-to-text-project.git
   cd speech-to-text-project

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!


### `npm run build` fails to minify
